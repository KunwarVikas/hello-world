/**
 * Median Stream
 * You're given a list of n integers arr[0..(n-1)]. You must compute a list output[0..(n-1)] such that, for each index i (between 0 and n-1, inclusive), output[i] is equal to the median of the elements arr[0..i] (rounded down to the nearest integer).
 * The median of a list of integers is defined as follows. If the integers were to be sorted, then:
 * If there are an odd number of integers, then the median is equal to the middle integer in the sorted order.
 * Otherwise, if there are an even number of integers, then the median is equal to the average of the two middle-most integers in the sorted order.
 * Signature
 * int[] findMedian(int[] arr)
 * Input
 * n is in the range [1, 1,000,000].
 * Each value arr[i] is in the range [1, 1,000,000].
 * Output
 * Return a list of n integers output[0..(n-1)], as described above.
 * Example 1
 * n = 4
 * arr = [5, 15, 1, 3]
 * output = [5, 10, 5, 4]
 * The median of [5] is 5, the median of [5, 15] is (5 + 15) / 2 = 10,
 * the median of [5, 15, 1] is 5, and the median of [5, 15, 1, 3] is (3 + 5) / 2 = 4.
 * Example 2
 * n = 2
 * arr = [1, 2]
 * output = [1, 1]
 * The median of [1] is 1, the median of [1, 2] is (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5 (which should be rounded down to 1).â€‹
